# Data on SARS-CoV-2 variants by _Our World in Data_
> For more general information on our COVID-19 data, see our main README file in [`/public/data`](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).

Enabled by data from <a href="https://gisaid.org"><img src="https://www.gisaid.org/fileadmin/gisaid/img/schild.png"
width="50"/></a>. 

The data is sourced from [GISAID](https://gisaid.org), via [CoVariants](https://CoVariants.org), and we make it available as a [CSV
💾](covid-variants.csv).


### Fields

| Column field        | Description                                                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `location`            | Name of the country (or region within a country).                            |
| `date`                | Date of the observation.                                                     |
| `variant`             | Variant name. We use the [WHO label](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/#Naming-SARS-CoV-2-variants) for Variants of Concern (VoC) and Variants of Interest (VoI), and Pango Lineage for the others. Details on variants included can be found [here](https://covariants.org/variants). |
| `num_sequences`       | Number of sequenced samples that fall into the category `variant`. |
| `perc_sequences`      | Percentage of the sequenced samples that fall into the category `variant`. |
| `num_sequences_total` | Total number of samples sequenced in the last two weeks. |

#### Special `variant` values

- `others`: All variants/mutations other than the ones specified (i.e. not listed [in this table](https://covariants.org/variants)).
- `non_who`: All variants/mutations without WHO label.

Note that `non_who` includes `others` and other variants. For instance, variant _B.1.16_ is counted in the `non_who` category but not in `others`, as it does not have a WHO label but is listed [in this table](https://covariants.org/variants).

As a consequence, for a given date, the sum of `perc_sequences` will exceed 1. In order to sum 1, you should exclude `non_who` category.

In this extract, we have that during the two weeks prior to 2021-03-08, in the UK, a total of 29598 samples were
sequenced. From these, 28,772 correspond to Alpha variant and 647 are variants without WHO label.
